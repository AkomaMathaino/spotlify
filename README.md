# Spotlify

This is the back end for an app similar to spotify. It includes:
* User authentication
* Account verification to verify users as artists
* A way for verified artists to upload music to the app
* Playlist creation for users and a way for playlists to be shared

Django is being used to model the data and handle HTTP requests. The app has also been containerized using Docker Compose.
